    <p>This is all about me!! </p>
    <p>I started music when I was in about 4th grade. I have loved and obsessed over it 
        ever since. I began voice lessons shortly after. My teacher was absolutely incredible.
        He influenced my love and interest in music more than he knows. We worked together on
        growing my range and increasing my skills. I would often get frusterated, but I loved 
        looking back on progress I made. All of my love for music also got me into recording. 
        I have recorded my own versions of a couple popular songs. I love being able to work on 
        a project like that. Editing vocals, adjusting sounds, and adding other tweaks. I am 
        also obsessed with concerts. They've become bucketlist items for me. I am so blessed to
        have music in my life and I couldn't imagine my life without it.
