    <h4>Recording</h4>
    <p>I began recording when I was in my sophomore year of high school. 
        I worked very hard on a few covers of songs artists I’ve been inspired by
         have written. I took a trip to Utah to record with my voice teacher. I had 
         such an incredible time and did not realize how much I would then be interested
          in music production and recording. I then looked into my own equipment to be 
          able to create a possible home studio. I began to learn about sound levels, 
          reverb, and layering audio. I would love to continue learning and growing my 
          recording skills.

    <h4>My Music</h4>
    <p>Music is clearly a big part of my life. I don’t post videos often, but I have 
        found that these are the best ways to share what songs I’ve worked on. I plan on 
        continuing to post my work here. As I record more as well, I will share these 
        songs too.
