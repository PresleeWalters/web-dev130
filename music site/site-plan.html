      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of this page is to introduce myself, as well as my love for music. It will hold my logo, and other images 
        representing aspects of music that I use. People will visit this site not necissarily for a specific
        purpose or activity. I would explain it as more informational than an interactive website. 
        It will also offer links to my social media accounts for the user to be able to go visit my pages.

      <h3>My Influencers</h3>
      <p>
        The goals of this page is to explain all the influences of music thoughout my life. There are so many artists that have 
        impacted my interests and goals in music. I will list a couple examples. 
      </p>
      <p>
-Harry Styles-

This one is a little more of an obvious one. Harry Styles is world-known for his sometimes odd sense of style, 
and upbeat music. I appreciate how clean his lyrics are, and how I can shuffle all of his albums without really 
having to skip anything. Similarly to other artists that have influenced me, he has a great balance of upbeat and
 scream in your car type songs, as well as emotional, heart tugging songs. 

-Adele-

I have always had an appreciation for Adele and for her music. She is very incredibly vulnerable in her music, 
and has an absolute powerhouse of a voice. Not only this, but she is very open to the public about human emotions. 
She has been through a lot, but has found much healing in her music. It has been her outlet, and is willing to 
share it with the world in hopes to offer others the same. 

-Charlie Puth-

Charlie is absolutely incredible. He can make the most incredible songs with the most random 
of noises and sound effects. He has such a love, passion, and obsession for music. He has perfect pitch and is 
very good at what he does. Not all of his songs are clean, but the ones that are have a catchy rhythm.

      <h3>Goals and Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        The goals for this page is to combine both goals I have for my own work, and work I have already done. I 
        would like to create a portfolio of sorts. My social media platforms will also be linked so people will have 
        access to my music.
